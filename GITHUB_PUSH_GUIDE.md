## Push Your Updates to GitHub

## Option 1: Automated Push (Recommended)

1. ‚úÖ Show you what files will be committed
2. ‚úÖ Create a detailed commit message
3. ‚úÖ Ask for confirmation before pushing
4. ‚úÖ Push to GitHub with full documentation

## Option 2: Manual Push

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with message
